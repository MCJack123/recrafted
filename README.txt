                     RECRAFTED

Recrafted is ComputerCraft's CraftOS but with saner
API design.  It's also not licensed under the CCPL,
but rather the MIT license -- so you can freely use
Recrafted's  code in  other projects  without being
legally  bound  to  license  them  under  the CCPL.

All  APIs  are  implemented  as  described  on  the
CC: Tweaked wiki at https://tweaked.cc, with slight
modifications   to  fit  Recrafted's   API  design.
